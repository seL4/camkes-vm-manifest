==================
The CAmkES VMM is a Virtual Machine Monitor that utilizes the CAmkES component platform.
Due to the static nature of CAmkES systems the VMM is specified at build time to run
on a particular hardware platform. Currently the VMM is mostly targeted to run on the
C162 platform from Aitech. There is also a configuration for running on generic x86
machines, but it has almost no hardware support.
